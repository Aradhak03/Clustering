# Clustering
<h2>Aradhak Kandhari-102103078</h2>

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms on iris dataset. 

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- To assess the effectiveness of different preprocessing techniques on clustering performance.
- To compare the performance of different clustering algorithms in grouping similar customers together.
- To determine the optimal number of clusters for each algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains the following features:
- Sepal Length: Length of the iris flower's sepals (in centimeters)
- Sepal Width: Width of the iris flower's sepals (in centimeters)
- Petal Length: Length of the iris flower's petals (in centimeters)
- Petal Width: Width of the iris flower's petals (in centimeters)
- Target: Species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

## Clustering Algorithms
The following clustering algorithms are evaluated in this project:
- KMeans
- Kmeans Shift Clustering
- Heirarchial Clustering

## Evaluation Metrics
The clustering performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Silhouette Score
- Calinski-Harabasz Index
- Davies-Bouldin Index

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the K-Means Shift algorithm and three clusters stands out as the most effective approach for clustering the Iris dataset, providing meaningful insights into the inherent structure of the data.
